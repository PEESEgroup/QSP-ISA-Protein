    - The one non-variational method + the paper showing it to be far suboptimal
- Significant advance over previous work?
    - We propose a new framework for performing approximate QSP, and we demonstrate the potential of this framework
    - Compared to entanglement dependent complexity framework, our framework offers much more fine grained control over fidelity vs CX count
    - Compared to variational approaches, our framework avoids variational tuning -> much less computation time.
- Obvious questions?
    - How did you choose those specific sparse approximations? We picked the simplest ones we could think of.
    - Does VQC improve the output? Yes, but at that point, it became pure VQC
    - In what situation is this method going to be applied? Improvements in QSP leads to advantages in Monte Carlo sampling and speeding up linear algebra calculations
