# README 





All protein and noisy simulation experiments along with the implementations for ISA and benchmak QSP methods 

## QSP-ISA-Protein


  - cpp - Implementations of ISA, ADAPT-VQE, AA-VQC
  - isa_cpp_demo.py, vqc_cpp_demo.py, search_cpp_demo.py -  python wrappers to cpp and used for protein experiments
  - isa.py, qc.py, util.py, parser.py - python implementation of ISA. Not used for final experimentation
  - isa_cpp_demo.py, vqc_cpp_demo.py, search_cpp_demo.py - Protein experiments for ISA, AA-VQC, and ADAPT-VQE -> results compiled in Protein_Results
  - noisy_simulation.py - Noisy simulation experiments on 5_qubit_state.txt -> Plots
  - ucg.exp - UCG runtime experiments
  - uniprot.py - encoding proteins from Uniprot into quantum states -> Protein_states_100
  - MPS_in_Qiskit : Github repo for preparing MPS circuits: https://github.com/henrik-dreyer/MPS-in-Qiskit
  - MPS.py, Protein_MPS - MPS experiments
