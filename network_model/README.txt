This module provides functionality for creating computation graphs, computing
the gradient, and updating internal parameters along a specified direction.

This module improves over the code in VQCNN by allowing nodes (layers) to take
multiple vector inputs and return multiple vector outputs, allowing computation
graph structures to be more complex than a straight line path.
